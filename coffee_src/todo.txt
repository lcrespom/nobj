REST DB layer
* POST for Create, PUT for Update, DELETE for Delete --> see http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/methodOverride.html
- Proper error handling
- Limits by configuration (e.g. max number of results to return etc.)
- Access control: allow operations depending on user identity
- Refactor data.connectHandler so dbParams can be passed during server startup, like this:
	svr.use('/data', data.connectHandler(dbParams))

UI Layer
- Start with example --> 2nd hand book website
- Abstract to naked objects

Dev env
- Automated tests
- Automated build (cake?)
- Automated repository integration (github?)
